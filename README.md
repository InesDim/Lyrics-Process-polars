# Lyrics Processing with Polars

## Description

This project demonstrates how to leverage the high-performance Polars library to process and analyze song lyrics data. It showcases various data manipulation techniques, including filtering, aggregation, and text analysis. Polars offers a powerful alternative to pandas, making this notebook especially valuable for those dealing with large datasets or seeking enhanced processing speed.

## Features

Efficient Data Loading and Processing: Leverages Polars for handling large datasets with optimized memory usage.

Text Filtering: Implements methods to filter lyrics based on specific criteria such as word presence or text patterns.

Data Transformation: Demonstrates how to clean and transform data for further analysis or visualization.

Exploratory Analysis: Provides insights into the dataset, such as word frequency or sentiment analysis (if applicable).
